# Skyward

All of her life Amy has lived in the darkness, in the safety of the
caverns her village has called home. Legends tell of a crystal above
that will grant anyone a single wish, but no one has seen the sky in the
generations. Enraptured by these tales, she packs for a journey to see
for herself if these stories are true. Armed with only a few spears and
rations for the climb, she sets off skyward to create a legend of her own...

## How to Play

Move Amy to the left with `A`, and to the right with `D`

Jump with `W`, and press `W` again while mid-air to jump again.

Throw a spear with `S`. You can have up to 3 spears on the screen at a
time. Use spears to defeat enemies and create platforms to help you
climb up.
